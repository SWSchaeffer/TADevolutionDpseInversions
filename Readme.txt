Fortran Program: BP TAD Power Analysis.f
Function: to estimate the probability of n inversion breakpoints out of N total breakpoints being in a TAD.

Input files: 
boundary.tsv  - list of beginning and end coordinates of TAD boundaries for the third chromosome of D. pseudoobscura
Gene_Coor.tsv - list of beginning and end coordinates of genes on the third chromosome of D. pseudoobscura

Output files:
2021_10_10 BP_in_TADs_Bootstrap_Summary_Data n=13.txt

Fortran Program: Extract Sequences from Contigs Batch.f
Function: This program extracts nucleotide sequences from a FAS format file with name contig_x.fas or scaffold_x.fas In this case,

Input Files:
contig_3 is the 23 Mb sequence of the third chromosome of D. pseudoobscura 
extract_list.txt - list of beginning and end coordinates of TAD bodies for the third chromosome of D. pseudoobscura.  This
file name is input in the program, but three different extract_list.txt files are used:

extract_list_BPs.txt - to extract breakpoint sequences
extract_list_Intergenic.txt - to extract intergenic sequences
extract_list_TAD_Boudaries.txt - to extract TAD boundary sequences

To use a file, copy the file to extract_list.txt.  Each row of extract_list.txt has: (1) a 30 character name, (2) beginning nucleotide
coordinate, (3) end nucleotide coordinate, and (4) orientation either + or -.

Output Files:
The information in each row of the extract_list.txt leads to the creation of a fasta file with name "name_xxxxxxxx_yyyyyyy.fas, where 
xxxxxxxx is the beginning coordinate and yyyyyyyy is the end coordinate.

Downstream Data Files generated by concatenating individual extracted sequence files from the different extract_list.txt files.
Dpse_UCI_Intergenic.fas 2413 intergenic sequences
Dpse_UCI_Breakpoints.fas 13 breakpoint sequences
Dpse_UCI_TAD_Boundary.fas 168 TAD sequences

Fortran Program: TAD Diff Expression Plot.f
Function: Draw a TAD map for the third chromosome of D. pseudoobscura along with inversion breakpoints

Input Files:
TADs.txt - list of beginning and end coordinates of TAD bodies for the third chromosome of D. pseudoobscura
BPs.txt  - list of beginning and end coordinates of inversion breakpoints for the third chromosome of D. pseudoobscura

Output Files:
TAD_Diff_Expression_Plot_Raw.ps - Adobe Postscript file of the TAD plot for Figure 3
Figure 3 TAD_Diff_Expression_Plot_Raw.pdf - Adobe pdf file created by conversion of the postscript file
